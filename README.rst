====================================
  Project Euler programming problems
====================================

Just for fun. Python is by far my strongest language, but I'm also currently trying out Erlang.

Run the Erlang examples from an Erlang shell:

::

  c(euler_one).
  euler_one:main().

Run the Python examples:

::

  python ./euler_one.py

`stdout` result is the Project Euler answer.
